</div>


**Mirror Installation**

Like Raspberry Pi, you need to install the ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C image from your SD card to get it up and running. We offer two ways to start ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C. You can boot from an SD card or from eMMC.

**A. Boot from SD card**

- **Step 1.** Select the [firmware](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/seeed-linux-images) you want to download:

- **Step 2.** Connect an SD card to a PC or MAC with an SD card reader, an SD card with more than 4G memory is required.

- **Step 3.** <font face="">Click here to download <a href="https://etcher.io/">Etcher</a>, then use the Etcher to write the  ```*.img.xz``` file directly to the SD card. Or extract the ```*.img.xz``` file into a ```*.img``` file, and then burn it to an SD card using another mirror write tool. 
<br>
<br>Click the plus icon to add the newly downloaded image file and the software will automatically select the SD card you inserted. Then click Flash! writing. It takes about 10 minutes to finish.</font>

![](https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Respeaker_V2/raw/master/img/v2-flash-sd.png)


- **Step 4.** After writing the image to the SD card, insert the SD card into ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C. Use USB type-c port to power the Carrier board. Do not take out the SD card during writing. ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C will boot from the SD card, you can see the PWR and USER LED lighting on SOM. Now, go to the next section: the serial console.

<div class="admonition note" >
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
they mean to start up failed if the USER LED does not blink.Please check the boot switch whether it is SD_CARD.
</div>
    

**B. Boot from eMMC card**

- **Step 1.** the process is the same as **A. Boot from SD card** if you first start up the ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C.

- **Step 2.** Edit /boot/uEnv.txt to start eMMC boot then reboot.

```bash
sudo echo cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3-stm32mp1.sh >> /boot/uEnv.txt
sudo reboot
```
- **Step 3.** Wait for the USER LED bright continuously.that indicate the eMMC boot successfully if the USER LED bright continuously.

- **Step 4.** Set the slide switch to EMMC and restart.

**Serial Console**

Now your ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C is up, you may want to access your Linux system through the console, then set up WiFi, and so on. Two serial port access methods are provided for Linux access: 

- A. OTG USB port - You need to run a Linux system on a circuit board.

- B. UART port - Used to debug low-level problems.

**A. Connect via OTG**

- **Step 1.** Take a USB type-c cable and make sure it's a data cable, plug it into ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C's USB type-c port, and then plug the other end of the USB type-c cable into your computer. 

- **Step 2.** Check whether the computer serial port is enabled:

    - Windows : Check the device manager, there should be a new serial device named ```COMx```, x is a bigger and bigger number. If you can not recognizes the driver you can visit [link](https://beagleboard.org/getting-started#troubleshooting) to install the driver.
    - Linux : ls ```/dev/ttyACM*```, should be ```/dev/ttyACMx``` x depends on the USB port you use.
    - Mac : ls ```/dev/cu.usb*```, should be ```/dev/cu.usbmodem14xx``` xx depends on the USB port you use.


- **Step 3.** Use your favorite serial debugging tool to connect to serial ports: 115200 baud rate, 8 bits, no parity bits, a stop bit 1, no flow control. Here are SoMe examples:

    - Windows : Use [PUTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), select ```Serial``` protocol, fill in the COM port corresponding to ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C,```115200``` baud rate, 8 bit, no parity bits, a stop bit 1, no flow control.
    - Linux : Depending on the USB To TTL Adapter, should be ```screen /dev/ttyACM0(,1, and so on) 115200``` or ```screen /dev/ttyUSB0(,1, and so on) 115200```.
    - Mac : Depending on the USB To TTL Adapter, should be ```screen /dev/cu.usbserial1412(,1422, and so on) 115200``` or ```screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1412(,1422, and so on) 115200```.


- **Step 4.** The default user name is ```debian```, the password is ```temppwd```.

**B. Connect via UART port**

In this section, we'll walk you through the use of the USB to TTL adapter, which connects to the ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C's Uart port(Located at the upper right of ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C), to establish a connection between your computer and ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C.

- **Step 1.** Connect Uart port To PC/Mac using USB To TTL Adapter.If you don't have USB To TTL Adapter, click [HERE](https://www.seeedstudio.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=UART) to buy.（RX->TX,TX->RX）

- **Step 2.** Using the following serial debugging tools, the baud rate is 115200:
    - Windows : Use [PUTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), select ```Serial``` protocol, fill in the COM port corresponding to ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C,```115200``` baud rate, 8 bit, no parity bits, a stop bit 1, no flow control.
    - Linux : Depending on the USB To TTL Adapter, should be ```screen /dev/ttyACM0(,1, and so on) 115200``` or ```screen /dev/ttyUSB0(,1, and so on) 115200```.
    - Mac : Depending on the USB To TTL Adapter, should be ```screen /dev/cu.usbserial1412(,1422, and so on) 115200``` or ```screen /dev/cu.usbmodem1412(,1422, and so on) 115200```.

- **Step 3.** The default user name is ```debian```, the password is ```temppwd```

- **Step 4.** If you don't have USB to TTL Adapter, you can also use Arduino. If you use Arduino, connect one end of the jumper to the Arduino's RESET pin and the other end to the Arduino's GND pin. This will bypass your Arduino's ATMEGA MCU and turn your Arduino into a USB to TTL adapter. Please refer [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqSLwK1DP8Q) Video tutorial. Now connect the GND pin of Arduino to the GND pin of ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C's Uart port. Connect Rx pins on Arduino to Rx pins on ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C's Uart port. Connect the Tx pin on the Arduino to the Tx pin on the ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C Uart port. Finally, connect the Arduino to the PC/Mac via the Arduino's USB cable. Now check to see if your PC/Mac has found your Arduino by typing the following command:

```
ls /dev/cu.usb* (Mac)
ls /dev/ttyACM* (Linux)
```
You should get feedback like this:

```
/dev/cu.usbmodem14XX where XX will vary depending on which USB port you used (on Mac)
/dev/ttyACMX where X will vary depending on which USB port you used  (on Linux)
```
Now follow the steps above to connect to ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C via a serial connection. This is usually what we need to do when we first boot up, as you will then set up ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C for Wi-Fi connection and then SSH connection.

**Network Settings**

**A. Wi-Fi Settings**

Configure the ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C network through the network management tool `connmanctl`, which has been installed on the ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C image. Follow these instructions to easily complete the configuration. 

```
robot@ev3dev:~$ sudo connmanctl

connmanctl> quit
```

Now use the following command to find ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C's IP address. 
```
ifconfig
```

**B. Ethernet connection**

You can connect to the network using an Ethernet cable. Just plug in the Ethernet cable to the Internet.

**SSH connection**

**A. SSH**

SSH, short for Secure Shell, is formulated by the Network Working Group of IETF. SSH is a security protocol based on the application layer. SSH is a more reliable protocol that provides security for remote login sessions and other network services. There is no SSH protocol in the image provided by us, so we need to configure it through the serial port, so as to realize the communication between the device and the computer through SSH protocol. Enter the following command to install the SSH service in ODYSSEY -STM32MP157C.

```bash
sudo apt install ssh -y
```

Next, we'll use SSH to access ODYSSEY – STM32MP157C. Windows users can use third-party SSH clients. For Linux/Mac users, the SSH client is built in.

- Windows users : Use PUTTY, select SSH protocol, fill in the correct IP address and click open. The user name is debian and the password is temppwd.

- Linux/Mac users :
```
ssh debian@IP
// password: temppwd
```
